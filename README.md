# 🏛️ Legal Aid Provider

Welcome to the **Legal Aid Provider LLM**! This project leverages the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide legal assistance by analyzing user queries and offering relevant legal insights. Whether you're dealing with consumer protection issues, criminal law, or property disputes, this tool is designed to guide you through the complexities of the legal system. ⚖️

## 🧠 Why RAG? 

The **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model is a game-changer for applications requiring domain-specific knowledge. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained LLMs, RAG enhances responses by retrieving relevant information from external sources like PDFs, databases, or APIs. Here's why RAG is crucial for this project:

- **Accuracy**: Ensures responses are grounded in verified legal documents.
- **Context-Awareness**: Dynamically retrieves information based on user queries.
- **Scalability**: Easily integrates with large datasets like legal acts, case laws, and regulations.

## 🛠️ Importance of Vectors in Legal Search

Vectors play a critical role in this project by enabling **semantic search**. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, vector-based search uses embeddings to understand the meaning behind queries and documents. Here's why this is important:

- **Improved Search Relevance**: Finds documents even if the query uses different terminology.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Handles large datasets with high-speed and accuracy.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Matches user queries with the most relevant legal texts.

## 🛠️ How LangChain Powers This Project

**LangChain** is the backbone of this project, enabling the orchestration of LLMs, tools, and retrieval mechanisms. Here's how it helps:

- **Prompt Engineering**: Custom templates for legal queries ensure precise and relevant outputs.
- **Tool Integration**: Combines LLMs with tools like FAISS, SerpAPI, and document loaders.
- **Agent-Based Workflows**: Implements agents for tasks like classification, retrieval, and question generation.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple legal domains with modular and reusable components.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User Query**: The user describes their legal issue.
2. **Law Classification**: The system identifies the relevant legal domain (e.g., consumer law, criminal law).
3. **Document Retrieval**: Relevant legal documents are retrieved using FAISS and LangChain's document loaders.
4. **LLM Processing**: The LLM generates a response based on the retrieved context.
5. **Feedback Loop**: The user can refine the query, and the system iterates for better results.

## 📚 Supported Legal Domains

| Domain                     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consumer Protection Law** | Handles issues like defective products, unfair trade practices, etc.        |
| **Criminal Law**            | Covers crimes, felonies, and related legal procedures.                     |
| **Property Law**            | Assists with disputes over ownership, tenancy, and property rights.         |

## 🌐 Example Use Case

**Query**: "I received spoiled milk and got sick. The provider refuses to take responsibility."

1. **Classification**: The system identifies this as a **Consumer Protection Law** issue.
2. **Retrieval**: Relevant sections from the **Consumer Protection Act, 2019** are retrieved.
3. **Response**: The LLM provides actionable insights, such as filing a complaint with the District Forum.
